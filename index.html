            <p>Identifcation and study of some simple statistics in the variation of SNP series
                across the human genome.</p>

            <p>HTML versions of the top level notebooks from the initial genomes_dnj study.
               These notebooks show data about the hierarchies and histories of SNP series
               in the region of chromosome 2 that includes the genetic variations for lacatase
               persistence.</p>
